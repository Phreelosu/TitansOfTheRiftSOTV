## ILSpied and gave it a facelift.

Feel free to report issues to me via the official modding discord's #tech-support channel by using @Phreel#0727 and I'll see what I can do but cannot promise anything.


`0.2.13`
- Mod hierarchy update again

# Titans of the Rift
### Adds several new enemies based on the League of Legends universe

Since discord embeds broke, you'll have to believe me. Mod currently adds:
- Chickens (Crimson Raptors)
- "Blue Buffs" (Sentinels)
- Reksai (as a boss, not a survivor)
- Rift Heralds
- Baron Nashors

## To-Do
- Config options
- actual logbook entries
- Clean up files
